Specifications: 

- Show the customer's first and last names in the output

# Question #4 SaleCo Database
  What is the total revenue for our customers with subtotals by invoice and overall revenue?

- Refer to the sample output given below and write your query to replicate the data exactly as shown (column aliases, some ordering, etc)
- Sort the results by customer last name then by revenue in descending order
- Do not show duplicate values for revenue in the revenue column as the previous question did for company revenue
- The exception to this would be if a customer only had one invoice number and their customer subtotal equaled their invoice line total
- Recall: revenue can be calculated by multiplying LINE_UNITS and LINE_PRICE.
